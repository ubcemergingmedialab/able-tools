## Contributing

* When creating a new tool, make sure to fully comment all code involved. 
* Include a scene titled "Example" showcasing how to use the tool.
* Everything in the scene should be as intuitive and easy to under stand as possible. When instructions are unclear, make sure to include instructions using text meshes in the scene.
* All code should be in the "EML" namespace. When a tool occupies multiple scripts, bundle the scripts together under a seperate sub namespace for that tool.
