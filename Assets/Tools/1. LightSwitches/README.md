# Light Switches

This tool provides a very simple tool for triggering lights on a trigger enter. The tool is configurable so that lights can have a set behavior for trigger enter and/or exit. Behaviors can either toggle the light on or off, or always set the light to a given state. See the example scene for select use cases. 

Tool is fully contained in the LightController.cs monobehaviour file.
