# Utility

This is a namespace for scripts and editor functions that are used across tools. Tools should be as stand alone as possible. However, to avoid duplicating code, general use scripts should be bundled in the EML.Utility namespace and put here.

Ideally, the Utility namespace could be a dll bundled with tool releases. 

NOTE: SampleAssets resources should not use this namespace, as they are intended to stand completely alone.
